# Spark Renderer üî•

**Spark** is an experimental 3D renderer in heavy development, designed to bridge the gap between **real-time performance** and **high-quality rendering**. Built with games in mind, it combines modern graphics techniques while prioritizing flexibility for future innovation.

*‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project is under active development - APIs may change and features are being rapidly iterated on.*

## ‚ú® Core Features

### Hybrid Rendering Pipeline
- **Ray tracing** for accurate lighting and reflections
- **Rasterization** for high-performance rendering
- Adaptive quality system that balances visual fidelity and frame rate

### Screen-Space Effects
- Screen-space reflections (SSR)
- Screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO)
- Screen-space global illumination (SSGI)

### Material System
- Physically-based rendering (PBR) workflow
- Metallic-roughness material model
- HDR environment lighting
